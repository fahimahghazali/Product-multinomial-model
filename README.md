<h1 align="center">Product multinomial model</h1>

### Project Objective
This project analyses the data provided under the multinomial distribution. Through this, hypothesis tests are done on the true proportions to see if all of them are equal to each other and on the true standardised residuals being zero. The test statistic is then sampled to confirm the assumption that it follows a chi-squared distribution. Complementing the tests, a further look on the confidence intervals wraps up the report.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

### Methods used
