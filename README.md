<h1 align="center">Product multinomial model</h1>

### Project Objective
This repository is a compilation of the R codes and the final submission of my first coursework doing MATH20811 Practical Statistics. The whole report focuses on correlation coefficients, mainly Pearson's and Spearman's as well as an introduction consisting of descriptive statistics. The main body of the report talks about hypothesis testing on the correlation coefficient using Fisher's Z-transform statistic. The distribution of said statistic is then further explored through data simulation in R.
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]
